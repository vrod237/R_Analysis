# R_Analysis

## Project Objectives

- Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
- Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
- Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
- Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.


## Resources
- Data Sources: Mechacar.csv, suspension_coil_test.csv
Software: Rstudio, R

# Challenge Overview

## MPG Regression

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?


- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?


- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?


## Suspension Coil Summary

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?

## Independent Study

Upper management is looking for your expertise and wants you to design a study that compares the performance of the MechaCar prototype vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market.

- First step would be to compare car characteristics that consumers care about such as: fuel efficiency, price, car size, and color options. In recent years, technology has also become a deciding factor in purchasing vehicles, safety features such as collision warnings, blind spot alert, emergency braking and rear/front traffic camera. There are other convenience options available at an extra price such a wi-fi, sound system, interior, rims and convertible.

- To determine the difference's between MechaCar and its competitors with similar vehicles, we can conduct a sample t-test for the numerical variables from MechaCar's sample and another sample from competitor vehicles. We can also conduct Chi-Square tests for the categorical variables from MechaCar's sample and another sample from competitor vehicles.

- The null hypothesis would be: there is no difference between the metric of MechaCar and similar competitor vehicles.

- In order to test the hypothesis, we would need to gather the metrics proposed for MechaCar and the competitor vehicles. Some of this data will include: MPG, Price, Car Size, Color Options and possible promotions. Continuous numerical options
