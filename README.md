# R_Analysis

## Project Objectives

- Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
- Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
- Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
- Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.


## Resources
- Data Sources: Mechacar.csv, suspension_coil_test.csv
Software: Rstudio, R

# Challenge Overview

## MPG Regression

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?


- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?


- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?


## Suspension Coil Summary

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?

## Independent Study

- Think critically about what metrics you would think would be of interest to a consumer (cost, fuel efficiency, color options, etc.).


-Determine what question we would ask, what the null and alternative hypothesis would be to answer that question, and what statistical test could be used to test this hypothesis.


- Knowing what test should be used, what data should be collected?
